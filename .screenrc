# Enable 256-color mode when screen is started with TERM=xterm-256color
# Taken from: http://frexx.de/xterm-256-notes/

# Note that TERM != "xterm-256color" within a screen window. Rather it is
# "screen" or "screen-bce"

# terminfo and termcap for nice 256 color terminal
# allow bold colors - necessary for some reason
